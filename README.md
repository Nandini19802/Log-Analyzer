It is the process by which computer-generated log messages are filtered, also known as log events, audit trail records, or simply logs. A log analyzer provides a valuable system of measurement that paints a clear picture of what has occurred across the structure. The data can be used to improve or solve functioning issues within an application or infrastructure. It is all about shortening the time a business needs to detect and solve production problems and allowing teams to focus more on enhancing current functionalities and attaching new functions to products and services they are generating instead of spending time troubleshooting.
